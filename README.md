# file-compression-decompression
This project is a simple SPA (Single page application) web based compression project written in Java, JavaScript/ React framework, and Spring Boot. This application also used a lot of UI frameworks such as MaterialUi (MUI).

This application is a Lossless compression application it uses the Gzip compression algorithm from the Apache Commons Compress library for compression. Its based on the DEFLATE algorithmn which basically combines LZ77 and Huffman coding. Its a general compression algorithm meaning it can be using on pretty much any type of  data it is great for text files such as html, css, js and othewr text based formats.

Many companies use the  Apache library for compression, Gzip in particular or other lossless compression algorithms for reducing server space and band width usage. Its also great for DB query performance and faster reloads on websites especially those of high traffic.
